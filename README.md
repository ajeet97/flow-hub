# FlowHub

**Complex DeFi Workflows Made Simple**

FlowHub is a visual workflow builder that enables users to create sophisticated DeFi transaction sequences on Flow blockchain without requiring technical knowledge of Cadence. Build, execute, and share complex multi-step DeFi strategies through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

## üöÄ Features

### **Visual Workflow Builder**
- Drag-and-drop interface for creating complex DeFi workflows
- No Cadence programming knowledge required
- Preview & validate workflow tx before executing

### **Atomic Execution**
- All workflows execute atomically using Cadence transaction scripts

### **Built-in DeFi Components**
- **Wallet**: Withdraw/Deposit Funds from wallet
- **Swap**: Exchange tokens across different DEXs
- **Liquid Staking**: Stake tokens while maintaining liquidity

## üìã Example Workflows

### Multi-Step Arbitrage Strategy
```
100 FLOW ‚Üí Swap to USDC ‚Üí Lend USDC ‚Üí Borrow stFLOW ‚Üí Deposit to Yield Protocol
```

### Simple Liquid Staking
```
100 FLOW ‚Üí Liquid Stake ‚Üí Receive stFLOW
```

### Leveraged Position
```
1000 USDC ‚Üí Deposit as Collateral ‚Üí Borrow FLOW ‚Üí Swap to USDC ‚Üí Repeat
```
